# Practical5.1Coupon
This is a public repository for my practical application assignment 5.1 "Will the customer accept the coupon?"

In summary - I analyzed the coupon data and found the groups of drivers that seem to be the most likely to accept the coupons targeted at them. 

These insights can inform more effective coupon distribution strategies, potentially invcreasing acceptance rates and customer engagement.
